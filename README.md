# fugger
This is a fork from the original repo for demo purposes while the original deployed version is in maintenance mode.

Fugger is a project from soon-to-be Web Developers who are studying at Wild Code School. 
With this web application users who run small businesses without an own finance department are enabled to manage and analyze their financial data easily.

Therefore they can upload the DATEV export they get from their tax advisor.

This data will be parsed and uploaded into the Analysis Table where actual values in expenses and revenues, the respective budgets and the calculated deviations can be viewed. Changes can be made directly in the table.

Budgets can be planned for now and the future.

The Analysis Table can be exported as an Excel File.
